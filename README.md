A 2D game inspired by the Github Game Off 2020 theme —— 'Moonshot'. <br />
The player controls the launch of a spaceship which must rely on the gravity of surrounding planets to land on the nearest moon. <br />
<br />
Created with the Godot game engine and self-made pixel art. <br />
Current version can be played at https://caitlingenna.github.io/LunarLoops/ <br />
Many more levels and improvements to come!
